The Polish Consulate in Tbilisi does not require an application for an escort by a family member. An application for consent to the entry of a child, if necessary, must be filled in on the spot.

The Polish Consulate in Yerevan requires a notarized consent to apply for a visa for a child. This form is at the notary. Plan your visit to the notary in advance.

Marriage certificate

The original document and the copy - for spouse

Birth certificate

The original document and the copy - for the child

If the child goes with only one parent, the notarized consent of the second parent is required for the departure of the child.

To apply for a visa - you need a notarized consent, Poles require. But when crossing the border - it is not necessary, one parent and a document confirming the relationship (entry in the passport or birth certificate) are enough.

If both parents submit a visa document, they simply both sign the child's application form (notarization is not necessary).

If there is only one legal guardian, this is reflected in the birth certificate, the court decision on granting custody or the death certificate of the other parent.

We recommend that you get a notarized consent from both parents now, so that in the future children can travel from Belarus with their grandparents and other people. It's easier to do it here than later in Poland.

Copies of passports

2 copies of the last spreads of the spouse's passport

Copies of parents' passports are attached to the documents for children.

For a visa for a minor child - if there is a notarized permission from the second parent, then a copy of the passport of only the parent who submits the documents is attached.
